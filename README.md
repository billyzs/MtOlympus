CS3733 Individual Project written by Shao Zhou (szhou2@wpi.edu).

I've included `ks_lib.jar` and the card images as dependencies. You can also find the necessary project setup file in for IntelliJ. Sorry I've no experience packaging projects in Eclipse.

93% code coverage as determined by IntelliJ's coverage plugin.
